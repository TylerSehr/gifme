# gifme
A gif making and sharing app. Users can take photos and/or gifs, apply filters and stickers over them. Or they can simply browse through the infinitely-scrollable homepage through other uploaded gifs. Photos and gifs can be rated, commented on, and exported to different forms of social media. Users have public facing profiles, and can see all the posts that they have favorited in the past. Additionally then can edit their profile, delete their posts, or delete their accounts.
